Anifa Mvuembas work builds an inclusivity for African women in the fashion industry through in her digital work. With her recent work, ironically she eliminated the body, to accentuate an inclusivity around the human form. She highlights the curves of African women, as opposed to the thin “model-esque” form over-saturated in the industry. With her clothing standing on their own, she plays on the symbolising of the meaning of clothing particularly with her heritage and cultural background. Ultimately her 3d animation encourages an inclusivity within the industry.
