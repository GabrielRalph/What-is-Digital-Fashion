Anifa Mvuemba’s art is built around her Congolese heritage, exploring the multifaceted form of a women through in her digital fashion work. With her recent line, presented by virtual “ghost-models” she eliminates the physical body to accentuate the way natural curves and shapes bring meaning to clothing draped in colours over the figures. This was inspired by the natural curves of the body, as opposed to the thin “model-esque” form over-saturated in the industry. With her clothing standing on their own, she plays on the significance of the symbolism of her garments with red meaning “blood and pain”, blue meaning “peace” and yellow “hope.” Ultimately her 3d animation exposes key elements to her cultural history and heritage, and encourages body inclusivity within the industry.
